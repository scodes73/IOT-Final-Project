# üõ°Ô∏è Static Security Analysis of Top-Grossing Health & Fitness Android Apps with IoT Connectivity (2025)

This repository contains the full workflow, scripts, and data used for a static security analysis of the top 100 grossing Health & Fitness apps on the U.S. Play Store (as of April 2025). The project evaluates apps against categories from the OWASP MASVS framework using APKHunt.

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Parser

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scodes73/IOT-Final-Project
cd health-fitness-security-analysis
````

### 2. Install dependencies and System Environment

Requires: `jq`, `python3`, `bash`, `unzip`, `jadx`, `dex2jar`, `go`, `apktool`, `zipalign`, `apksigner`, `curl`, `jq`


### 3. Extract app IDs from snapshot
Acquire the snapshot.json from AppFigures website, select your filters on the webpage while the dev tools being open, you can get the `snapshot.json`
```bash
bash Scripts/jq.sh Scripts/snapshot_sample.json > app_ids.txt
```

### 4. Fetch APKs from APKPure

```bash
bash Scripts/xargs-code.sh
```
This uses underlying Scripts/apkpure-dl.sh 


### 5. Converting xapk to apk
Run this in your folder where you have .xapk files, uses xapk-to-apk.py from https://github.com/LuigiVampa92/xapk-to-apk
```bash
for i in *.xapk; do python xapk-to-apk.py $i;done
```


### 6. Passing .apk to APKHunt
```bash
go run apkhunt.go -m ~/path-to-your-apk-directory -l
```
This will generate all the .html and .txt files

### 7. Run the parser
Run the parse in the existing folder with all the .txt or change the folder path in parser.py
```bash
python Parser/parser.py 
```

This extracts relevant MASVS findings from HTML into `.txt` files.

### 6. Review aggregated results

The final output is located at:

```
Parser/combined_report.xlsx
```
